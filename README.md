# The API for string light list, a lightweight task-tracking website

This is one half of Sparrow Rubin's second General Assembly Web Development Immersive project.

## Design Notes

These are structured to meet General Assembly's planning requirements.

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to create tasks.
2. As a user, I want to be able to mark tasks complete.
3. As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
4. As a user, I want to understand how my data is being stored and used (privacy policy stuff).
5. As a user, I want to be able to access the tasks from multiple computers.

### Planning

I'm going to make a task tracking app. Google Sheets presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ous0t4LIjgonQzyA8oxDlR5jNTRDuG98-x-glByuxvM/edit?usp=sharing).

(Reminder: Use two tildes to ~~strike-through~~ with markdown.)

Current roadmap:
0. Customize template projects and upload to Github.
1. deploy API template w/ github and heroku.
2. ensure logging into the API works w/ curl.
3. deploy simple front-end client to github pages.
4. ensure logging into the API works via the FE (front end).
5. update API to handle task CRUD (creation, reading, updating, destroying).
6. ensure task CRUD works via curl.
7. update FE to support task CRUD.
8. verify minimum project requirements met.
9. update roadmap for non-minimum requirements.
