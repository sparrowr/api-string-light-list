# The API for string light list, a lightweight task-tracking website

This is one half of Sparrow Rubin's second General Assembly Web Development Immersive project.

## Design Notes

These are structured to meet General Assembly's planning requirements.

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to create tasks.
2. As a user, I want to be able to mark tasks complete.
3. As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
4. As a user, I want to understand how my data is being stored and used (privacy policy stuff).
5. As a user, I want to be able to access the tasks from multiple computers.
